One-Way TFTP Client

This client is designed for a **unidirectional data transfer system**,
specifically for use with a custom data diode. Unlike standard TFTP,
it operates in a "fire-and-forget" mode, sending all packets to a fixed
port (69) without expecting or waiting for any acknowledgments (ACKs)
or responses from the server. This design choice is fundamental to its
purpose: to function across a network link where a return path is
[cite_start]physically impossible, such as with a fiber optic data diode[cite: 36, 37].

The client's primary assumptions are:
1. The server is always listening on the designated port (69).
2. [cite_start]The network path is one-way, so no ACKs will ever be received[cite: 99].
3. The sender's ARP cache has a static entry for the receiver, bypassing the
   [cite_start]need for an ARP request which would fail on a one-way link[cite: 58, 60].

The main design limitations include:
1. **No Reliability**: Since there are no ACKs, the client cannot confirm
   if a packet was received. [cite_start]Packet loss is not detected or handled[cite: 147].
2. **No Congestion Control**: The client sends packets at a fixed rate
   (with a millisecond delay) instead of adjusting based on network
   [cite_start]conditions, which could lead to buffer overflows at the receiver[cite: 149].
3. **No Error Correction**: The client assumes data integrity and cannot
   [cite_start]re-transmit lost or corrupted blocks[cite: 147].

Usage examples:
# Terminal 1: Start fixed server
python3 oneway_tftp_server.py --config oneway_tftp_server_config.yaml

# Terminal 2: Send 20MB file
python3 oneway_tftp_client.py large_file.pdf
